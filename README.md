PART – A
1. Prepare a detailed report on different devices available in various layers of computer network
architecture.
2. Given a valid IPV4 address, separate the Network and Host ID part and determine the class of
the given IPV4 address. (Using a C program)
3. Simulate the working of sliding window protocol for flow control in computer networks. (Using
a C program)
4. Simulate the working of distance vector routing algorithm using Bellman-Ford’s algorithm.
5. Write a client-server program in TCP / IP in which the server-side code listens for connect
requests, and whatever message the client sends the server converts it to uppercase and sends it
back.
6. Write a program to generate a Hamming Code for a four-bit data. The program should also
detect and correct error for the received data.
PART – B
1. Using Wireshark capture, filter and inspect packets.
a. Capture Ethernet / Wi-Fi Packets.
b. Filter TCP, UDP, HTTP, DNS Packets.
c. Capture filter for telnet that captures traffic to and from a given host.
2. Using ESTINET simulator carry out the following exercises (topology will be given during the
experiment conduction.)
a. Draw a wired network topology (using hub, switch and router) and set the parameters like
“Bandwidth”, “Bit Error Rate”, and “Propagation Delay” and run the simulation to calculate
the number of packets dropped.
b. Draw a topology of a wireless network involving host, router, obstacle, access point, ad-hoc,
infra and multi interface mobile nodes of 802.11 (a/g) and set the parameters of different
nodes used. Calculate the number of collisions occurring at a specified node.
